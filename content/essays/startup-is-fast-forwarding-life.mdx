The essence of life lies in discovering meaning that sustains you. Running a startup accelerates this journey, continually unveiling new facets of yourself.

As Pado's co-founder, my options for activities are quite limited. My role necessitates getting tasks done, regardless of my enjoyment. While maintaining a low burn rate is commonly advised, I prioritize minimizing personal burnout.

Motivation springs from engaging in activities we enjoy, find intriguing, and believe in. This enjoyment is crucial, as it fuels the momentum needed for sustained effort.

Currently, my responsibilities span the entire spectrum, as it's just Q and myself. I'm tackling engineering tasks, conducting research, authoring tech blogs, and crafting marketing materials. Yet, here lies the irony:

Even as someone who aspired to a career in software engineering, who is passionate about technology and immersive tasks, I increasingly prefer strategizing and initiating tasks, often finding myself eager to delegate the implementation.

For the time being, I'm coping well, largely thanks to the support from ChatGPTâ€”indeed, what would I have managed without you, OpenAI? However, looking ahead, I recognize the need to recruit individuals for tasks that, while necessary, don't align with my interests. This realization will likely serve as my cue.
