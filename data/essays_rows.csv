Even when they're eating, they'd watch videos on YouTube. The real issue with contents though, is that they're still localized, which also differs on a scale. Also, they're hard to be organized. It's hard for people nowadays to organize and structure information into a conclusion, since they get bombarded with them. So it all comes down to a needs for these roles, and LLMs are a perfect utility for this purpose."

I am person who learns quickly from personal experiences. In other words, I've always got to learn it the hard way. After quitting my job as a BD at Deer Corporation, an e-cooter startup based in Korea, I quickly assembled a team and started to doing projects with them. Little did I know that things started cracking apart when I didn't assemble a team centrifuged into a single interest. Here's what I've learned during the past five months spending with them. (Head's up, they're not really sorted out in a MECE format.)

1. Team-fit exists. Putting up a team from individuals with great performance and potential, doesn't guarantee the team to excel. In this situation, the team really doesn't get things done properly due to the conflicts in making decisions. Besides, being a good friend and great coworker is completely different.
2. Early teams must be lean. Any sorts of gathering that has a sole purpose should not be over three. The more person there is, less speed you'll be gaining. The concept of inertia is applied to people, too. Business is all about momentum, and it seems like a big team without any discipline will not get you anywhere.
3. You've got to have dedication. I've met so many brilliant people. But I've rarely seen a people with such intelligence to be dedicated to a single problem. I agree that there are so many things to be done in the world right now and there will always be more to solve. It's just how the world works. I also understand that there are so many interesting things that one cannot hesitate but to pay their interest towards it. But you can't make progress unless you spend time and effort on something, just a single one, for a shit load of time. If you've made a decision to work on something, suck it up and neglect everything else.
4. Do NOT exceed your capability. I found out that I can manage up to two projects at a time, but the output will not look good for either one of them. I know that I am person that needs to focus on one thing, and one thing only. If I am assigned to two or more projects, I know that I am going to drop one sooner or later, or else I'd flunk them all.
5. Home is NOT a place to work. I can assure you. NO ONE is productive in their homes, unless their under some special circumstances such as taking care of the baby and working at the same time. For ordinary people like us? Hell no. I am not taking that bull crap.
6. Credibility is everything. Credibility allows us to have transactions between one another. The best way to keep yourself credible is to not make any promises. However, the if you neglect the small ones, such as being tardy frequently, you will lose faith from others. (Mark my words.) There are two things to do to overcome this. The first, of course, is acting like the person with manners you'd hope for. Being punctual and sticking to the plan are things that applies to me. (I really hate people who are always late. I think they are inconsiderate, arrogant, and retarded.) Also, you need to be resilient. You must be firm on what you stand, which doesn't mean that you should be an asshole. But rather, you must think things through and try to evaluate things while trying to keep your edge."

As Pado's co-founder, my options for activities are quite limited. My role necessitates getting tasks done, regardless of my enjoyment. While maintaining a low burn rate is commonly advised, I prioritize minimizing personal burnout.

Motivation springs from engaging in activities we enjoy, find intriguing, and believe in. This enjoyment is crucial, as it fuels the momentum needed for sustained effort.

Currently, my responsibilities span the entire spectrum, as it's just Q and myself. I'm tackling engineering tasks, conducting research, authoring tech blogs, and crafting marketing materials. Yet, here lies the irony:

Even as someone who aspired to a career in software engineering, who is passionate about technology and immersive tasks, I increasingly prefer strategizing and initiating tasks, often finding myself eager to delegate the implementation.

For the time being, I'm coping well, largely thanks to the support from ChatGPT—indeed, what would I have managed without you, OpenAI? However, looking ahead, I recognize the need to recruit individuals for tasks that, while necessary, don't align with my interests. This realization will likely serve as my cue."

비록 내가 벤처의 꿈을 안고 다른 길을 걷고 있지만, 언젠가는 다시 품고 싶은게 원자력이다. 그래서 이렇게 미국의 벤처캐피탈에서 해당 분야에 관심을 갖고 있다는걸 보면 뿌듯하면서도 부럽다. 민간에서도 도전이 이루어질 수 있는 환경이 조성되어 있고, 그걸 키워내줄 자본이 존재한다는건 축복이다. 
이공학이 세상에 새로운 변화를 만들어내는 것은 자명하다. 나도 나중에, 나중에는 에너지를 해보고 싶다. 아마 나의 도전의 끝은 원자력일거 같다. 내 아이돌 토니 스타크가 군수에서 에너지 회사로 피봇했던 것처럼."

친구와 헤어지고 다른 친구와 집에 와서 이야기를 나눴다. 예술이 하고 싶다는 이야기를 듣고나서 하면 되지 않냐고 물었다. 친구는 자기가 아는게 없다고 했다. 난 알아야 하냐고 물었다. 배우면 되지 않냐고. 

하고 싶은걸 찾고, 그 중에서 선택하고, 선택에 후회하지 않으며, 변심하지 않고 몰두하는게 가장 어려운 일이라고 생각한다. 물론 그 과정에서 타협이 있을순 있지만, 그게 하고자 하는바를 이루기 위한 전략이라면 뭐 어떤가?

나도 이렇게 말은 하지만, 실로 지키기 어려운거 같다. 찾아내는걸 억지로 할수도 없거니와 설령 “찾아”낸다 한들 오래가지 못하는거 같다. 심지어 두근거리는 아이디어들이 많을때 그중에서 선택하는건 정말 어려운 일이다. 

의심될 수 밖에 없다. 의심할 수 밖에 없다. 나라는 사람이 어떤 사람인지 모르기 때문에 스스로 의심할 수 밖에 없다.

그런데 그냥 해야 한다. 그러기로 약속했으니까. 그러기로 마음 먹었으니까. 그래야 하니까. 이게 날 증명하는 순간이니까.

30,2024-01-29 17:02:31.015237+00,Artist,"We should all aim to become artists. While many people nowadays fixate on money, history tends to remember great individuals for their deeds, not their wealth. 

But, do we all have to be great? Well, no. But must we all strive for greatness? Not necessarily. **Yet, if you, like me, aspire to leave a mark on the world, then indeed, you should pursue greatness.** First off, what's not great? That is mundane.

Being mundane is either normal or pathetic. Being mundane is not standing out. Being mundane is not contributing to a better world. Being mundane is being a boring person. Being mundane means no flavor, no color, nothing whatsoever. **Being mundane is dying.**

The whole purpose of life is to pursue a calling. A calling that you're willing to sacrifice the ""easy"" life --- working 9 to 6, enjoying hobbies, enjoying whiskey, and so on.

I tend to think of these callings in terms of what I'd like to be remembered for at my funeral. Pursuing a calling is about writing the most interesting story there has ever been. **No other story should excite you.** If so, you're probably working on the wrong thing.

Stories may turn out to be similar. This is quite common. After all, knowledge is a collective asset built by ""people"". Similar ideas, therefore, often emerge at the same time. 

However, that's okay. Your work primarily needs to resonate with you. Ideas may start out from the same seed. But working on it, **that is what will differentiate you from others.** It's your execution, your story, and your life.

If everyone embraced the artist within, the world would be full of rich stories, far more exciting than those of people who merely show off their bodies or wealth online. The world would be much more peaceful. The world would be much more beautiful. The world would be much more thoughtful.

""오늘 레슨하는데 제자가 말을 듣지 않아서 진짜 개빡침...""

""오늘 레슨하는데 제자가 말을 듣지 않아서 진짜 개빡침...""

""와 정말? 나는 과외할 때 제자가 말 안들으면 회초리 들었는데, 너는 그래도 말로 잘 타이르는구나. 그래도 애정이 있으니 화가 나는걸거야. 언젠가는 네게 감사함을 표하는 날이 올거니까 좀만 더 힘내보자.""

어떤가? 풍미를 더 해주지 않는가?

38,2024-10-06 13:14:49.057955+00,Projecting Our Worlds Through Words,"Language shapes the way we communicate and interact with others, and as Ludwig Wittgenstein famously said, “The limits of my language mean the limits of my world.” In a world where humans are constantly interacting, effective communication is essential. Yet, it is a task fraught with difficulty. The diversity in backgrounds, perspectives, thoughts, and emotions creates inherent challenges in how we understand one another. People often underestimate the precision required to communicate clearly, which leads to misunderstandings and, consequently, arguments. This highlights a key point: communication and debate are not the same. While communication involves the exchange of ideas, debating often becomes a battle to prove one’s logic superior. This distinction is vital, especially when considering the importance of vocabulary.

The words we choose and how we arrange them form the foundation of communication. However, even this process is imperfect. Words are, after all, social constructs passed down through generations, and their meanings often evolve over time. Take the word _debate_, for example. According to the Oxford Dictionary, a debate is defined as “a formal discussion on a particular topic in a public meeting or legislative assembly, in which opposing arguments are put forward.” But what does _discussion_ mean? A discussion is simply “the action or process of talking about something in order to reach a decision or exchange ideas.” In essence, a debate is nothing more than a structured conversation, yet the emotions we attach to the word often invoke images of conflict—yelling, arguing, or boredom. This illustrates a larger point: a word’s dictionary definition is only part of its meaning. People have emotional associations with words, which can shape how they are perceived and used in different contexts.

Interestingly, many of us don’t fully understand the words we use daily. Studies suggest that the average adult only knows the dictionary definitions for about 10-20% of the words they commonly use. This knowledge gap often leads to miscommunication because people fail to align their intended meaning with the words they choose. The ambiguity of language makes effective communication even harder. To become a better communicator, especially in a business context, it is essential to choose practical words that are widely understood or to clearly explain the context behind your word choices. However, even with precise word choice, the success of a conversation often comes down to the attitudes of the participants. A willingness to listen, empathize, and clarify meanings is what ultimately fosters understanding.

In conclusion, communication is a complex and often misunderstood process, but it is vital for successful human interaction. While words and vocabulary play a fundamental role, understanding the emotions, associations, and attitudes behind them is equally important. To explore this further, there are excellent resources available, such as [How you win any argument](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhAQOH3H6Ts), [How to speak](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Unzc731iCUY), and the [Anatomy of an Internet Argument](https://defenderofthebasic.substack.com/p/anatomy-of-an-internet-argument). Mastering communication requires more than knowing words—it requires understanding people."
